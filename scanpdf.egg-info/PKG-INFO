        If you're looking for a simple way to use a multi-page scanner and get your
        document into a PDF in Linux without any proprietary or commercial software,
        then ScanPDF might be the solution.  I wrote it to quickly take the Linux SANE
        scanner system output image files, and process them into usable PDFs.  By
        usable, I mean PDFs that maintain their original scanned resolution, omit blank
        pages (if you're scanning in duplex mode, for example), preserve color unless
        the original is greyscale/black and white, in which case they are intelligently
        down-converted to B/W PDFs to save space.

        Features
        --------
        * Uses SANE/scanadf to automatically scan to multi-page compressed PDFs
        * `Integrates with ScanBd <http://virantha.github.io/scanpdf/html>`_ to respond to hardware button presses
        * Automatically removes blank pages.
        * Scans in color, and automatically down-converts into 1-bit B/W image for text/greyscale images
        
        Usage:
        ------
        The simplest way to use this is:
        
        ::
        
            scanpdf scan pdf <pdffile>
        
        This will first perform the scan, and then the conversion to PDF.  If you want
        to split up the scan and the PDF conversion into two separate invocations (for
        reasons clarified below), then you can do:
        
        ::
        
            scanpdf --tmpdir=tmp scan
            scanpdf --tmpdir=tmp pdf <pdffile>
          
        One reason for the separation might be if you want to keep scanning documents
        (very quick) while the post-processing (slower) for the PDF conversion is
        taking place in the background.   For instance, if you're using the hardware
        button on the scanner to initiate scans (as detailed in this_ document), then
        you want to return immediately after the scan instead of waiting for the full
        conversion to PDF has taken place.

        You can optionally use the following switches to control if you're putting pages face up or face down in the auto
        document feeder, if you want to skip the blank page processing, adjust the blank page detection threshold, or add 
        additional post-processing using unpaper_:
        
        .. _unpaper: http://unpaper.berlios.de
        
        ::
        
                --dpi=<dpi>                 DPI to scan in [default: 300]
                --face-up=<true/false>      Face-up scanning [default: True]
                --keep-blanks               Don't check for and remove blank pages
                --blank-threshold=<ths>     Percentage of white to be marked as blank [default: 0.97] 
                --post-process              Run unpaper to deskew/clean up
        
        
        Right now, I'm assuming this is getting called via ScanBD, so I don't have the option to manually specify the 
        scanner.  If you really want to use this standalone, for now, please just set the ``SCANBD_DEVICE`` environment 
        variable to your scanner device name before running this script.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        ::
        
            $ pip install scanpdf
        
        Requires ImageMagick and SANE to be installed, for the command line tools:
        
        * ``convert``
        * ``identify``
        * ``ps2pdf``
        * ``scanadf``
